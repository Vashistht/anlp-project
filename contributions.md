# Contributions 

## Vashisth (vashistt)
- Code
  - Incorporated GSM-8K CoT prompt creation
  - Incorporated a combined metric into the score function that decides the masks and solves the regression problem
  - Researched and incorporated various different datasets for evaluation 
  - Optimized the code for speed up such that data is not loaded every eval run 
  - Ran a variety of experiments on pruning with respect to ppl on wiki, c4, and gsm8k
  - Ran a variety of experiemnts on pruning with combined metric 
-  Report:
   - Introduction, Background, and Discussion sections
   - Contributed to the method and result sections

## Amanda (xal)
- Code
  - Implemented lexicographical similarity and accuracy for pruning evaluation metric
  - Implemented combined weighting evaluation metric (to be iterated on later)
  - Ran a bunch of experiments and evaluations, etc (I've lost track)
- Report
  - Compiled results tables from all the runs
  - Wrote up results sections, parts of dataset sections, etc

## Emily
- Code
  - Implemented semantic similarity calculations for combined pruning metric
  - Generated pruning masks for various combinations of metric weights
